# Message Logger For Discord
- A simple message logger for Discord, written in discord.js. Commands: !startlog | !stoplog.
- Please edit the configs.
- Everything explained in the index.js file.
- Not going to update this anymore, so if its going to be patched, or sum like that, I'm not going to fix this.
- And if you get banned, it's not my fault - this program is against TOS

- U can choose, to only log in the console, or log into a specific channel.
